# SkillsUSA-Competition-Inhouse

This repository houses the project I created to enter into the regional Skills USA competition for Maine.

It is a small proof of concept for a 2D platformer that wraps around the faces of a 3D cube, which can be rotated to view all sides. Included is a demo scene which displays the ability to walk around all four sides and return on the same side you began on.
